            Visualizing <em>Survivor</em> contestants using <a href="https://github.com/MTurner0/survivor-tsne/blob/main/tsne-maker.py">t-SNE</a>.
            The embedding includes features such as how many <a href="https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Confessional">confessionals</a> a contestant had, how long they lasted in the game, which US state they live in, etc.
            If a castaway <a href="https://mturner0.github.io/survivor-network-graph/">has appeared on multiple seasons</a>, they will have a separate point for each appearance.

            Hover over a point to learn about the contestant it represents.
            Change the drop-down menu to change the color scale (legends coming soon!).
            Brush over the graph to zoom in, and double-click to reset the axes.
